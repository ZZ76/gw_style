A Gordon Walters' koru style filter

This program is inspired by [The Koru series](http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues1to40/walters.htm) of [Gordon Walters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Walters). It can create a random koru style image or can be used as an image/video filter.

The koru image is generated based on a low resolution image which could be in gray scale or binary.
